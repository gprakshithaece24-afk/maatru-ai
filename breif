## Current State
- Three login roles: Pregnant Woman, ASHA Worker
- Woman dashboard with voice assistant (Web Speech API), health log, pregnancy tracker, nutrition tips, SOS button
- ASHA worker dashboard with beneficiary list and risk color coding
- Three-language support (English, Hindi, Kannada) across all pages via LanguageContext
- Login flow: phone → OTP → role selection

## Requested Changes (Diff)

### Add
- Third role option "Family Member" (👨‍👩‍👧) on the role selection screen in LoginPage
- Family Member stored role key: familyMember in localStorage
- New route /dashboard/family 
- New page FamilyMemberDashboard.tsx with:
  - Header with language switcher and logout
  - Patient relation input (dropdown: Husband, Mother, Mother-in-law, Sister, Brother, Other)
  - Patient problem description textarea ("What problem is the patient facing?")
  - Patient name field
  - Call ASHA Worker button (large, prominent, shows a confirmation dialog with ASHA worker contact info)
  - Status display showing patient's last known status (mock: green/yellow/red)
  - Emergency SOS button
- New translations for family member role in login.ts (en/hi/kn)
- New translations file for family dashboard (family.ts) in en/hi/kn
- Route guard redirect: if storedRole === "familyMember" → /dashboard/family

### Modify
- LoginPage.tsx: Add family member option to role selection grid (3 cards instead of 2); add redirect for familyMember role; update handleRoleSelect to handle "family" role
- App.tsx: Add familyDashboardRoute for /dashboard/family
- login.ts: Add family member role translations in all 3 languages
- WomanDashboard.tsx: Fix voice assistant — add permission request handling, fix lang code to support English (en-US) and Kannada (kn-IN) alongside Hindi (hi-IN) based on current selected language

### Remove
- Nothing removed

## Implementation Plan
1. Update login.ts translations to add family member role strings (all 3 languages)
2. Create src/frontend/src/translations/family.ts with full en/hi/kn translations for family dashboard
3. Create src/frontend/src/pages/FamilyMemberDashboard.tsx with all the required UI sections
4. Update LoginPage.tsx: add "family" to SelectedRole type, add family member button in role step, add redirect logic for familyMember stored role, handle role select for "family"
5. Update App.tsx: import FamilyMemberDashboard, add familyDashboardRoute
6. Fix WomanDashboard.tsx voice assistant: map language context to correct BCP-47 lang code (en → en-IN, hi → hi-IN, kn → kn-IN), add microphone permission error handling with user-friendly message

## UX Notes
- Family member card: blue/indigo color theme to differentiate from rose (woman) and green (asha)
- Family dashboard: simple, clear layout — large touch targets, minimal jargon
- Call ASHA Worker button: prominent, orange/amber color, opens a dialog showing ASHA contact details and a "Call Now" link (tel: link)
- Voice fix: language code must match user's selected language so speech recognition works in the right language; show a clear "Microphone permission denied" toast if permission is blocked
